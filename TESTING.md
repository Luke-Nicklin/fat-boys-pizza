## Negative testing

Tests were carried out to ensure validation messaging would appear if a user attempts to:

1. Book a date in the past
2. Book a table with more guests than the table capacity
3. Book a table that is already booked for the same date and time
4. Edit a booking so there are more guests than the table capacity
