# FatBoysPizza

FatBoysPizza is a restaurant booking web app for a fictional pizza restaurant based in Chelmsford, Essex. The app allows restaurant staff and customers to easily manage restaurant bookings. The customer can register, login and create a booking for a date and time that suits them. They can then edit this booking or cancel the booking via the web app. The live link can be found here: <link>

# Site goals

The website aims to help the restaurant to take bookings online and allow staff to easily keep track of upcoming bookings and make changes to bookings when neccessary.

The website also aims to help customers to easily view the restaurant's menu and book a table online. They will also be able to edit the booking and cancel the booking via the website.

 # Planning
 ## Agile

To develop this project I used an Agile approach, dividing the work into phases and building the website iteratively to maximise efficiency. I used a kanban board with tickets containing different user stories with prioritised labels that included 'Must have', 'Should have' and 'Could have'. Each ticket defined the user story and the acceptance criteria.
